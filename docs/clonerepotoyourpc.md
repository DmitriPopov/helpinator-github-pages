# Clone repo to your PC

Now we need to clone repository to our local PC. Run command prompt, change the folder to our documentation folder, say "C:\Project\Help" and call git:



```
```


This will create a folder "helpinator-github-pages" in "C:\Project\Help" folder. Browse to it and create "docs" subfolder, this is where we will publish our documentation.



[Export GitHub pages from Helpinator --&gt;](exportgithubpagesfromhelpinator "Next")
